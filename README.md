# description
• Imitated P-Machine architecture that implements memory and virtual machine instructions through stacks in C programming
• Interpreted code written in valid PL/0 language and translated into an internal representation to be used in a Parser
• Utilized lexical, semantic, and syntax analysis to identify errors and generate assembly code for successful PL/0 compilation
# how to run & compile
• Download hw4compiler.c and any input files in the same directory
• Use gcc hw4compiler.c in the terminal, to compile
• Use ./a.out INPUT_FILE_NAME.FILE_TYPE, to run the program
